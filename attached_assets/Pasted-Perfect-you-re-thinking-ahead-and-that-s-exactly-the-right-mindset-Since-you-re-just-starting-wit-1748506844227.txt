Perfect — you're thinking ahead and that's exactly the right mindset. Since you're just starting with **Python basics** and are interested in **data science**, let’s build a beginner-friendly project **that teaches Python in an interactive way**, using **Flask (Python)** and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

---

## 🧩 Project Proposal: “Learn Python: Interactive Basics App”

### 🎯 Purpose:

An interactive web app that teaches users the basics of Python through short lessons, quizzes, and a built-in mini console (to run example code snippets).

---

## 🔧 Stack:

* **Backend**: Flask (Python) — to serve pages and process quizzes/code
* **Frontend**: HTML + CSS + Vanilla JavaScript — for interactivity
* **Optional Later**: Add SQLite for saving user progress or results

---

## 🧠 Target Audience:

* **Absolute beginners** who want to learn Python basics (ideal for people like you just getting started with coding/data science).

---

## ✨ Core Features:

### 1. **Lesson Pages**

* Teach concepts like variables, loops, functions, etc.
* Markdown or HTML-formatted content from Flask backend

### 2. **Interactive Quiz**

* Multiple-choice questions at the end of each lesson
* Show immediate feedback (right/wrong)

### 3. **Mini Code Runner (Simulated)**

* User types Python code in a textbox
* Code is sent to Flask for evaluation (carefully sandboxed)
* Output is returned and displayed

### 4. **Progress Tracker** (Optional, for future)

* Track which lessons are completed
* Store scores locally or with basic user login

---

## 📐 Design / UI

* Clean, minimal layout
* Navigation bar: Home | Lessons | Quiz | Practice
* Use soft colors, readable fonts (great for learners)
* Responsive for mobile/tablet

## 🟢 Ready to Begin?

Would you like me to:

1. **Set up the base Flask app** so you can run it locally or in Replit?
2. Start building the **first lesson page** and quiz?
3. Help with a mini code execution backend (advanced but cool)?

Let me know what you want to work on first — I can generate the starter code right away.
